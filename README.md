DamJS
=====

A tool for analysing StreamLink communication

--

1. Download DamJS and host it. I recommend "http-server", "npm install http-server".

2. Create a scriptmarklet from the "scriptmarklet.js" file.

3. Click on the scriptmarklet on any StreamLink app hosted on http. Sadly, https will not work for security reasons.
